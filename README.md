# fastsnipe
poorly coded c++ minecraft name sniper

## disclaimer
you probably wont win any names with this if they're being sniped by anything else, the code is poorly written and rushed.

## building
Build static libcurl for vc19

Build fastsnipe in Release/x64 with vc142 build tools

## using
dont? but if you insist, write a config.json file in out/Release that follows the specs in src/config/config.cpp
